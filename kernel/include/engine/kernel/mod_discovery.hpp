// being silently ignored: a directory the user dropped into the mods tree is
// an attempt to install a mod, and a broken install must be visible, not
// swallowed. Loose files are not packages and stay unreported. A directory
// with a broken or conflicting manifest is a precise startup problem (one
// report line, the package dropped). Discovery is sorted by path so behavior
// never depends on filesystem iteration order. Packages whose id is in
// disabledIds are skipped on purpose and not reported; a duplicate id is
// reported and the later package dropped. A missing or non-directory path is
// a valid state (no packages). Returns the active packages in discovery
