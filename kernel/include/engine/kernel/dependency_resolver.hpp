// Resolves the component graph: every component (module or mod) is ordered so
// that providers construct before consumers, shared capability requirements
// resolve to a single provider, and every failure mode produces one precise
// diagnostic instead of a vague error.
//
// Optional capabilities (ComponentManifest::optionalCapabilities) ride the
// same resolution machinery as required ones - exact providers first, then
// family members, then the configuration's [providers] choice, and an
// ambiguous optional capability is the same startup error, because a silent
// pick would make behavior depend on scan order. The one difference: zero
// providers resolve to "not available" instead of an error, and no edge is
// added. When a provider DOES exist, the edge is added like a requirement's -
// the consumer acquires the implementation during construct.
//
// The resolver is a pure function over manifests: it holds no backend state and
// never touches component instances, which is what makes the kernel startup
// validation a dry run.
