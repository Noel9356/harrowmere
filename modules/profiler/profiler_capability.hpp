// other modules, native mods, the app - includes THIS header, from the
// module that provides the capability: the provider owns and publishes its
// own capability vocabulary, so there is no central contract directory and
// no mirrored copy that could drift. Like every published capability header
// this stays implementation-, platform- and vendor-agnostic; the per-module
// purity guard in the module's CMakeLists enforces that mechanically.
// See mods/README.md, section "Portability".

// Capability "profiler": CPU-side instrumentation. Consumers feed two kinds
// of measurements - counters (monotonically growing amounts: bytes read,
// objects spawned, cache hits) and samples (named durations recorded once
// the measured work has completed). The provider owns aggregation and
// reporting: when and where the numbers land is the provider's policy, not
// the caller's, so a replacement implementation can write to a file, a
// network stream or an overlay without one consumer changing.
//
// The surface is deliberately free of any output concept: a consumer never
// asks for a report, it only contributes measurements. That keeps the calls
// cheap enough for per-frame use and keeps the capability portable - nothing
// here names a destination, a format or a thread.
