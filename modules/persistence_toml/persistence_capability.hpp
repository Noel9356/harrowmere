// The published capability surface of the persistence module. Every consumer -
// other modules, native mods, the app - includes THIS header, from the module
// that provides the capability. Like every published capability header this
// stays implementation-, platform- and vendor-agnostic.
//
// The capability is the runtime save/load for the scene registry: the whole
// live object list (transforms, materials, mesh instances) serializes to one
// TOML file and reads back the same way - TOML everywhere, per the engine's
// configuration policy. Loading spawns the saved objects as NEW registry
// objects (handles are runtime values and are assigned fresh); it never
// merges into existing objects, so load-after-save is an exact restore only
// when the registry was empty or clearScene() ran first.
//
// Mesh objects are saved by their registry mesh NAME (handles are runtime
// values a file cannot legally carry): loading requires the named meshes to
// be registered at load time - the same run, or an import that ran first
// (imports register meshes under deterministic names, and registration is
// idempotent by name).
