// Shared surface relight for every SDF tracing consumer (the cascade march's
// hit points, the gather's starved-pixel fallback, reflection ray hits):
// outgoing diffuse radiance of a surface point under the direct lights, with
// the point's TEXTURED material. One function, one truth - all consumers
// sample the same texture sets the G-buffer pass rasterizes with, so GI
// bounces and reflections carry the same albedo/roughness the direct pass
// sees.
//
// Deliberate limits (documented in docs/architecture.md):
// - normal maps do not perturb the relight (the SDF gives the geometric
//   normal; the bounce difference is second order);
// - the function itself is the DIRECT term only - light arriving at the hit
//   point from other surfaces comes from the cascade field. The radiance
//   cascades' multi-bounce mode ([lighting.radiance_cascades].bounces > 1)
//   adds the previous bounce's gathered transport at the hit point in the
//   march shader, on top of what this function returns.
