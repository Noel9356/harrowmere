// The published capability surface of the renderer's overlay seam. Every
// consumer - other modules, native mods, the app - includes THIS header, from
// the module that provides the capability. Like every published capability
// header this stays implementation-, platform- and vendor-agnostic: no Vulkan,
// GLFW or platform header may appear here (the capability header guard,
// cmake/capability_header_guard.cmake, enforces that mechanically).
//
// What the seam is for: immediate mode debug UIs that must draw INSIDE the
// frame, after the composite pass wrote the swapchain image and before the
// present transition (so captures see the overlay too). The seam is one
// registration and one per-frame virtual call; the renderer stays UI agnostic
// and the UI provider stays renderer agnostic at the type level - the only
// contract between them is the opaque backend handle bundle documented below.
//
// The capability is the implementation-bound member "renderer.vulkan.overlay"
// of the module "renderer_vulkan" - deliberately a MEMBER, not a family: the seam's
// contract IS the Vulkan handle bundle documented below, so demanding it by
// family would let a different backend satisfy the demand with a bundle whose
// fields mean something else. A run with a debug UI names the member, the
// resolver hands it the renderer's host, and the UI module initializes its own
// backend against the bundle. Without a UI module nothing changes: the
// recorder pointer stays null and the recording path costs one branch per
// frame.
