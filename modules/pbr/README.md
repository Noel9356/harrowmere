# pbr module

The analytic direct-lighting technique. The pbr module attaches a compute pass to the renderer through the technique interface (`modules/renderer_vulkan/render_interface.hpp`), owns the scene light state behind the `LightingCapability` (capability family `lighting`, published in `lighting_capability.hpp` next to this module — the light-state vocabulary travels with its provider; the plugin descriptor and manifest carry the implementation-bound member name `lighting.pbr`), and writes the DIRECT radiance layer the composite adds. It is named after its algorithm — physically based rendering direct transport — because technique modules are named after algorithms, never after rendering categories (`docs/architecture.md`).

## The LightingCapability

The pbr module is the capability's provider: the sun is set with `setSunLight`/`clearSunLight`/`hasSunLight`/`sunLight(const)`, and point lights are managed with `addPointLight`/`removePointLight`/`clearPointLights`/`pointLightCount`/`pointLight(index)`. The state is consumed once per frame by the lighting passes; `[scene.sun]` and `[[scene.point_lights]]` in the configuration only SEED it. Live point lights are capped at 16; `addPointLight` returns the invalid handle when the cap is reached, so a caller can react instead of silently overwriting an existing light. Light descriptions are plain primitive values (directions, colors, radii), so the published header stays implementation-, platform- and vendor-agnostic like every other capability surface. C++ mods acquire this capability to drive lights at runtime; script mods interact with lighting through configuration today, because the Lua bridge grows deliberately.

## The direct pass

`shaders/pbr_lighting.comp` evaluates Cook-Torrance GGX for every G-buffer pixel against the sun and all point lights, with analytic SDF soft shadows: shadow rays sphere-trace the same analytic scene SDF the renderer rasterizes against (one geometry truth — the shared parameterization in `scene_common.glsl`), and the penumbra factor shapes the soft shadow width. The dark-side details that make it robust:

- Shadow rays leave the surface through a guarded origin: the G-buffer normal carries the normal map, and a normal-mapped normal can push the offset point inside the analytic SDF — the origin then re-offsets along the SDF's geometric normal.
- Point-light shadow rays terminate AT the light: a ray traveling past the light would shadow whatever sits behind it.
- When the assembly also demands the `indirect_specular` layer capability (no shipped module provides it — a custom reflection technique module can; the name is the reserved layer-contract spelling both sides of the hand-off share), this pass dims its analytic specular by a Fresnel weight so the direct pass and the indirect specular pass SPLIT the specular energy instead of drawing the sun twice on glossy pixels. The hand-over point is the shared `[lighting].max_roughness` key (default `0.5`), read by both sides so the two halves of the hand-off can never drift apart.
- The relight of first-bounce hit points (shared with GI and reflections through `surfaceOutgoingRadiance` in `relight_common.glsl`) stores physically scaled LAMBERTIAN radiance, so every stage of the transport chain carries the same energy unit.

## Wiring

| Manifest field | Value |
|---|---|
| provided capabilities | `lighting.pbr` (the `lighting` family's implementation member — the scene light state), `pbr_direct_diffuse` (the technique's demand marker) |
| required capabilities | `logging`, `renderer` |
| required permissions | `capability.logging`, `capability.renderer` |

The module provides two capabilities: `lighting.pbr` (the scene light state every lighting pass reads — the implementation-bound member of the `lighting` family, so consumers keep demanding the family and a run that needs THIS provider names the member exactly) and `pbr_direct_diffuse` (its demand marker — the name says which technique computes the direct transport, instead of spelling only the abstract radiance layer it fills). It is activated exactly when an active mod demands one of them. A run that demands only `lighting` gets the state with an idle pass; demanding `pbr_direct_diffuse` attaches the analytic pass.

## Configuration

The module ships these values in its own `config.toml` (the lowest configuration layer — `config/engine.toml` and staged overrides win over them, see `docs/configuration.md`).

The sun and point lights are seeded from `[scene.sun]` and `[[scene.point_lights]]` (see `docs/configuration.md`, section "[scene]").

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shadows` | bool | `true` | analytic SDF soft shadows for sun and point lights |
| `penumbra` | float | `12.0` | soft shadow penumbra factor (higher = sharper) |
| `shadow_steps` | integer | `24` | sphere-tracing steps per shadow ray. Keep this value in step with the GI module's `shadow_steps` — an under-budgeted relight shadow ray returns partial light inside sealed rooms and the probe grid amplifies the error into blocky patches |
| `max_roughness` (under `[lighting]`) | float | `0.5` | the shared specular hand-off point with an indirect specular layer: roughness values at or below it ride the indirect layer, values above it stay with this pass's analytic specular. Only consumed when the assembly demands `indirect_specular` (see above) |
