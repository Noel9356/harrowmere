// The published capability surface of the lighting state, provided by the pbr
// module. Every consumer - other modules, native mods, the app - includes
// THIS header, from the module that provides the capability: the provider
// owns and publishes its own capability vocabulary, so there is no central
// contract directory and no mirrored copy that could drift.
//
// Mod-facing and implementation-, platform- and vendor-agnostic: light
// descriptions are plain primitive values; the lighting passes behind this
// capability may be PBR compute passes today and another technique tomorrow.
// Script mods do not call this directly yet (the Lua bridge is the script ABI
// and grows deliberately); C++ mods acquire this capability like any other.
