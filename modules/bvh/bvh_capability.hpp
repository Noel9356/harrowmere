// The published capability surface of the bvh module. Every consumer -
// other modules, native mods, the app - includes THIS header, from the
// module that provides the capability. Like every published capability header
// this stays implementation-, platform- and vendor-agnostic: boxes are plain
// values, the contract is numbers in and numbers out.
//
// Provider model: this header is the family contract ("bvh"). The provider
// in this module is the implementation-bound member "bvh.binary" - a binary
// bounding volume hierarchy over caller-supplied boxes, its split strategy
// configurable ([bvh].split, default "midpoint": the benchmark winner, see
// modules/bvh/binary_bvh.hpp). A different spatial index (a grid, a dynamic
// BVH) declares its own member of
// the family and wins through the [providers] configuration section; consumers
// keep demanding "bvh" and notice nothing but the answers.

// Capability "bvh": CPU-side "what is near what" answers over axis-aligned

//
// Why a module: several consumers need the same spatial index - the physics
// module culls collision pairs through it, and a future CPU SDF bake (the
// renderer's cost model is linear in the object count; a baked distance field
// needs fast neighborhood queries) would rest on the same answers. One
// provider, demand-driven like every module: a run whose mods do not pull a
// consumer of the family never pays for it.
//
// Stateless service: every call takes the full box set and answers from a
// hierarchy built over it. At the engine's registry caps a rebuild costs
// microseconds, and a stateless contract needs no invalidation protocol -
// the caller's box list is always the newest truth there is.
