// The published capability surface of the audio module. Every consumer -

// module that provides the capability. Like every published capability header
// this stays implementation-, platform- and vendor-agnostic: file paths,
// handles and volumes.
//
// Provider model: the family member in this module is "audio.miniaudio"
// (miniaudio, vendored as one pinned header). A different backend declares
// its own member of the family and wins through [providers]; mods keep
// demanding "audio".
