// Math shared by the radiance cascades march and gather stages (screen-space
// placement - the placement shipped with the build; see
// modules/radiance_cascades/README.md).
//
// Two things live here because both stages previously carried byte-identical
// copies that had to be kept in sync by comment alone (a mismatch would
// desynchronize the line-of-sight check from the field the probe actually
// carries). One definition removes the failure mode instead of policing it:
//
// - The precomputed direction table (see the buffer below): the angular
//   schedule used to be a function here that every consumer re-evaluated with
//   4-5 transcendentals per direction. The schedule is a pure function of the
//   configured angular mapping ([lighting.radiance_cascades].mapping:
//   octahedron, cubemap or spherical_harmonic) and the ray budget, constant
//   across cascades AND frames, so it is computed once per rebuild on the CPU
//   (RadianceCascadesPass::rebuild -> buildDirectionTable: octahedron texel
//   centers, cube face texel centers, or the octahedron grid again for the SH
//   projection - each texel with its EXACT solid angle) and uploaded as this
//   buffer.

// quadrature stays exact in every mode; the spherical_harmonic mapping uses

//   slab start pulls the anchor just in front of itself (continuous, from the
//   cell centre's view depth) so the march never starts behind geometry.
// - Mixed-cell anchor: the cell's far surface, just in front of itself and
//   clamped into the slab (anchoring on the framing occluder would read the
//   whole cell dark - the automated leak check fails exactly that way).
// - The pure/mixed classification is a CONTINUOUS blend: a hard branch put
//   neighbouring cells on opposite anchors, their fields disagreed, and the
//   compose bilinear interpolated stair steps between them. The blend ramps
//   over 25% of the slab (floored at 30 cm for the near slabs).
