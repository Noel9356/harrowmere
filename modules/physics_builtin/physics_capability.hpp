// The published capability surface of the physics module. Every consumer -
// other modules, native mods, the app - includes THIS header, from the
// module that provides the capability. Like every published capability header
// this stays implementation-, platform- and vendor-agnostic: bodies are
// plain values, the simulation contract is numbers in and numbers out.
//
// Provider model: this header is the family contract ("physics"). The
// built-in provider in this module is the implementation-bound member
// "physics.builtin" - a compact rigid body simulator sized for the engine's
// analytic scene (spheres, boxes, a ground plane). A full engine provider
// (for example one wrapping Jolt) declares its own member of the family and
// wins through the [providers] configuration section; mods keep demanding
// "physics" and notice nothing but the behavior.
