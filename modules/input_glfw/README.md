# input_glfw module

Keyboard, mouse and gamepad aggregation for the whole engine, plus action mapping and text input. The module attaches GLFW key, cursor-position, scroll and joystick callbacks to the windows created by the window_glfw module and exposes the `InputCapability` (capability name `input`, published in `input_capability.hpp` next to this module; the plugin descriptor carries the implementation-bound member name `input.glfw`). The capability stays implementation-agnostic — no GLFW types cross it — so consumers are written once and survive a windowing backend swap.

## Contract

Two consumption styles, both frame-friendly. Discrete devices are polled: `isKeyDown(KeyCode)` and `isMouseButtonDown(MouseButton)` report current state at any point in the frame. Continuous devices are consumed deltas: `consumeMouseDelta(double& deltaX, double& deltaY)` and `consumeScrollDelta(double& deltaX, double& deltaY)` drain the motion accumulated since the last call — exactly once per frame per consumer — which decouples consumers from event ordering and from the platform's event batching. `setCursorCaptured(bool)` switches the platform cursor to disabled + raw motion where available, and `isCursorCaptured()` reports the mode; around every capture transition the module clears pending deltas so no accumulated jump is reported on the first frame after capture or release.

The module also publishes events on the event bus for event-driven consumers: `KeyPressedEvent` / `KeyReleasedEvent` (the screenshot_png module subscribes for its configured trigger key; the Lua bridge exposes `engine.subscribe_key_pressed` / `subscribe_key_released`), `TextInputEvent` (text-shaped input — the Lua bridge exposes `engine.subscribe_text_input`), and `GamepadConnectedEvent` / `GamepadDisconnectedEvent` (polled buttons and axes live on the capability: `isGamepadButtonDown`, `gamepadAxis`). The free-fly camera uses polling instead of events because continuous motion belongs in the frame loop. The stable key name table (`keyCodeName` / `keyCodeFromName`) is capability metadata and lives in the same published header as inline functions, so every consumer embeds the table it uses and no plugin depends on another plugin's symbols at load time.

Gamepad polling is on-demand by binding, not by query: `actionStrength` polls the device (`glfwGetGamepadState` + deadzone rescale, one poll shared by every binding of the action) only when the action actually binds a gamepad control — a keyboard-only action map (the fly camera's, on a keyboard run) pays zero device polls no matter how many action queries the frame makes. Gamepad-bound actions, `isGamepadConnected`, `isGamepadButtonDown` and `gamepadAxis` poll as before, and the connection-transition events fire from the same polls they always did.

## Wiring

| Manifest field | Value |
|---|---|
| provided capabilities | `input.glfw` (the `input` family's implementation member) |
| required capabilities | `logging`, `window` |
| required permissions | `capability.logging`, `capability.window` |

## Configuration

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `input.gamepad_index` | integer | `0` | which GLFW joystick the capability polls (0 = first device) |
| `input.deadzone` | number | `0.0` | stick rescale floor: axes with \|value\| below it read exactly 0, the rest remap linearly from the floor to 1.0 (0.0 = raw passthrough) |
| `input.actions.*` | map | — | the action map (dynamic keys, below) |

The `[input.actions]` map is merged from every configuration layer that defines it — the module's own `config.toml`, a mod package's `config.toml` (where the shipped demo bindings live) and the assembly's `engine.toml`, with the higher layers winning. One action = one comma-separated binding string; each binding is a key by its stable name, `mouse:<button>`, or `gamepad:<control>` (buttons and axes: `gamepad:A`, `gamepad:LeftTrigger`, ...; the mouse also accepts the platform's extra buttons as `mouse:4` .. `mouse:7`). `actionStrength(name)` returns the strongest currently-held binding — keys and buttons contribute 1.0 when held, axes contribute their clamped 0..1 value (after the deadzone rescale) — and an unconfigured action reads 0, so rebinding is a configuration edit and consumers query by meaning (`engine.action_strength("jump")`). The shipped example binds `boost` and `release_cursor`.

Everything else on the `[input]` section belongs to consumers: the renderer's camera tuning lives under `[scene.camera]`, and behavior (which keys, what sensitivity, what the cursor mode is) is the consumer's decision, not the device module's.

## Consumer reference: the free-fly camera

The renderer integrates a fly controller every frame from the input capability when present (`modules/renderer_vulkan/camera_controller.hpp` — header-only, driven entirely through this capability): **WASD** flies, the mouse looks while the cursor is captured (**Esc** releases; **F** or left-click re-captures), **Space**/**E** rise, **Ctrl**/**Q** sink, **Shift** multiplies speed, and the wheel scales the base speed. Each axis also accepts a semantic action name: when the assembly defines `camera_forward` / `camera_back` / `camera_left` / `camera_right` / `camera_up` / `camera_down` in `[input.actions]`, the controller polls those instead of the fixed keys (the shipped `boost` and `release_cursor` actions are wired the same way) — a gamepad binding flies the camera with no code. The controller is the reference consumer for the delta discipline — one drain per frame, no polling of raw motion, no assumptions about event counts.
