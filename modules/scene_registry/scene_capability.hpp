// The published capability surface of the scene module. Every consumer -
// other modules, native mods, the app - includes THIS header, from the
// module that provides the capability: the provider owns and publishes its
// own capability vocabulary, so there is no central contract directory and
// no mirrored copy that could drift. Like every published capability header
// this stays implementation-, platform- and vendor-agnostic.
//
// The capability is the RUNTIME object registry: it starts from the static
// world (the renderer pushes the parsed [scene] objects into it during its
// start phase) and then accepts mutations from any granted consumer - script
// mods through the scripting bridge, native mods and sibling modules through
// this interface. The renderer and the lighting techniques rebuild their GPU
// data from the registry incrementally: the primitive and material buffers
// are allocated once at full capacity and only their CONTENT is re-uploaded,
// so no descriptor set, pipeline or buffer handle is ever invalidated by a
// scene edit - the consumers' reverse-dependency teardown never replaces a
// live handle.
